# 12-Weeks-DevOps-Foundation-Project
A complete 12-weeks DevOps Foundation journey covering Linux, Git, CI/CD, cloud, IaC, containers, orchestration, monitoring, and automation. Each week includes hands-on projects, scripts, and documentation designed to build practical, job-ready DevOps skills step by step.

# A DevOps Engineer's Journey — 12 Week Project Series
**A complete hands-on roadmap from Zero → Job-Ready DevOps Engineer**

Welcome to the **DevOps 12-Week Project Repository** — a structured, project-driven learning experience designed to help you build **real-world DevOps skills** through practical, end-to-end projects. Each week focuses on one major DevOps skillset, with projects that simulate real workplace scenarios. By the end of Week 12, you will have a full DevOps portfolio covering Git, CI/CD, Docker, Kubernetes, Terraform, Monitoring, Cloud Infrastructure, Security, SRE practices, and more.

**Learning Philosophy**
This program is built around:
* Hands-on practical projects
* Iterative learning (each week builds on the last)
* Toolchain mastery: The exact tools used in real DevOps teams
* Cloud-first thinking (AWS/GCP/Azure optional paths)
* Production-ready patterns

# Weeky Breakdown (Weeks 1–12)
# 📌WEEK 1: DevOps Foundations & Tooling
**Project 0: Set Up Your DevOps Toolchain**
## Goals
* Understand DevOps principles
* Set up a complete DevOps workstation
* Learn Git, IDEs, Linux basics, containers, networking, cloud fundamentals
* Configure security and automation tooling
### Key Deliverables
* GitHub repo initialized
* Git workflow practiced (branching, PRs, merge, tagging)
* Docker installed & tested
* VS Code (+ extensions) configured
* Basic CI pipeline created (GitHub Actions)
* Cloud CLI setup (AWS/GCP/Azure)
* SSH keys & personal security basics
