# **Week 2: Linux & Bash Automation — Introduction**

Week 2 focuses on helping you understand how Linux systems work behind the scenes and how to automate repetitive tasks using **Bash scripting**. This week acts as the foundation for real DevOps work because almost every server-side task — from deploying applications to managing users — depends on Linux and shell automation.

---

## **Why This Week Matters**

Modern DevOps teams rely heavily on automation. Instead of manually creating users, assigning permissions, or running routine maintenance, we use scripts to do the job quickly, consistently, and securely.
Learning this skill now gives you the power to:

* Work faster and reduce human errors
* Manage servers at scale
* Handle real-world DevOps tasks confidently
* Build solutions that run themselves (cron jobs, daily tasks, etc.)

---

## **What You Will Learn**

By the end of Week 2, you will understand:

### **1. Bash Scripting**

You will learn how to write scripts that run commands automatically.
This includes:

* Variables
* Loops
* Conditions
* Functions
* Reading files
* Automating system tasks

Bash is the “automation language” of Linux, and mastering it puts you ahead as a DevOps engineer.

---

### **2. Linux Permissions**

You will learn how Linux controls access using:

* Users and groups
* File ownership
* Read / write / execute permissions
* The `sudo` system
* Best practices for secure user management

This is essential for understanding how secure multi-user systems operate.

---

### **3. Cron Jobs**

You will explore how to schedule automatic tasks using `cron`.
Examples include:

* Running scripts every day
* Backing up logs
* Cleaning old files
* Running maintenance tasks at night

Cron jobs make your automation run even when you’re not there.

---

## **Project for Week 2: Automating User Setup**

Your main project this week is to build a script that:

* Reads a list of new developers
* Creates user accounts
* Assigns permissions
* Adds them to groups
* Configures secure access
* Handles onboarding automatically

Instead of manually adding users one by one, your script will do the entire job in seconds — just like real DevOps teams do.

---

## **Conclusion**

Week 2 builds your essential Linux automation skills.
By the end of this week, you will be able to:

* Understand Linux fundamentals
* Write and run Bash scripts
* Automate real-world tasks
* Build systems that manage themselves

This is where thinking like a DevOps engineer begins.
